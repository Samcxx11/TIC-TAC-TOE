### Additional recommendations:

1. Create a `screenshot.png` showing your game in action and place it in the same directory
2. Consider adding a short demo GIF to showcase animations
3. For Windows users, you might want to add more detailed setup instructions
4. If you upload to GitHub, the markdown will render nicely with proper formatting
